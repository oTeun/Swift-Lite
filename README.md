# SwiftLite (DISCONTINUED)
 Free Powerful Minecraft Name Sniper
 
# Warning:
This sniper is discontinued and outdated, if you want to snipe names, the fastest sniper as of right now is https://github.com/Kqzz/MCsniperPY :)

# Usage:
 1. Make sure you have Python 3.8 installed
 2. Make sure you have the library 'requests-futures' installed
 3. Create a file named Accounts.txt
 4. Put the accounts you want to snipe with in that file like email:password
 5. (optional) Put the skin you want to upload when you snipe a name in the folder with name 'Skin.png'
 6. Run SwiftLite.py and the rest explains itself
